The computation time follows the O(2^n) law, where n is the number of iterations. The time taken is of the order of to 2 to the power of the number of iterations.

tree_np is faster to 15 iterations by a whole order of magnetude. It looks almost linear initally before a power type turn can be seen towards the larger number of iterations.
